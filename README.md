### Waypoint Updater
The waypoint updater is responsible for calculating the next LOOKAHEAD_WPS (100) Waypoints and setting a target velocity for each. The default target velocity at each waypoint is set at system startup and recorded into the base waypoints. This velocity is used as a ceiling for the vehicle velocity and intentionally left unaltered by the waypoint updater. At each call to the waypoint updater, a subset of the base waypoint list is created of length LOOKAHEAD_WPS, starting with the calculated NEXT_WAYPOINT. The velocities of these waypoints are then set to allow smooth  deceleration . To aid in this, the current vehicle velocity and maximum acceleration value are used to determine the distance required by the vehicle. This value is recorded as the deceleration zone.

### Overall Architecture

### Drive By Wire (DBW) Node
The DBW node is the final step in the self driving vehicle’s system. At this point we have a target linear and angular velocity and must adjust the vehicle’s controls accordingly. In this project we control 3 things: throttle, steering, brakes. As such, we have 3 distinct controllers to interface with the vehicle.

#### Throttle Controller
The throttle controller is a simple PID controller that compares the current velocity with the target velocity and adjusts the throttle accordingly. The throttle gains were tuned using trial and error for allowing reasonable acceleration without oscillation around the set-point.

#### Steering Controller
This controller translates the proposed linear and angular velocities into a steering angle based on the vehicle’s steering ratio and wheelbase length. To ensure our vehicle drives smoothly, we cap the maximum linear and angular acceleration rates. The steering angle computed by the controller is also passed through a low pass filter to reduce possible jitter from noise in velocity data.

#### Braking Controller
This is the simplest controller of the three - we simply proportionally brake based on the difference in the vehicle’s current velocity and the proposed velocity. This proportional gain was tuned using trial and error to ensure reasonable stopping distances while at the same time allowing low-speed driving. Despite the simplicity, we found that it works very well.



### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
